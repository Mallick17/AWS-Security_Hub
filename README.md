### 1. **Continuous Monitoring of Foundational Data Sources**
GuardDuty automatically monitors three main AWS data sources:

1. **AWS CloudTrail management events** ‚Äì Tracks user activities like API calls.
2. **VPC Flow Logs** ‚Äì Logs traffic going in and out of your EC2 instances.
3. **DNS Logs** ‚Äì Tracks domain name lookups made by your resources.

<details>
 <summary>Click to view Example</summary>

### Example:

Suppose an EC2 instance starts making DNS queries to a known malware domain (e.g., `bad-malware-site.ru`). GuardDuty detects this through DNS logs and alerts you with a finding like:

> *"EC2 instance is communicating with a known command-and-control domain."*

üìò No manual setup is required‚Äîjust enable GuardDuty and it starts monitoring.

</details>

---

### 2. **Extended Threat Detection (Multi-Stage Attacks)**
Detects **attack chains** that span multiple logs, AWS services, or over time. It correlates events that might seem harmless individually but are dangerous when combined.

<details>
 <summary>Click to view Example</summary>

### Example:

1. An attacker logs into your account using a compromised credential (CloudTrail log).
2. Then launches a new EC2 instance (CloudTrail).
3. That EC2 instance starts scanning internal IPs (VPC Flow Logs).

GuardDuty pieces these events together and creates a single **attack sequence finding**, like:

> *"Suspicious EC2 activity: Unauthorized access followed by lateral network scanning."*

üìò Extended Threat Detection is **enabled by default** and has **no extra cost**.

</details>

---

### 3. **Use-Case Focused Protection Plans**
