# AWS Security Hub
AWS **Security Hub** is a **cloud security posture management (CSPM)** service that **centralizes and automates security checks** across your AWS environment. It aggregates findings from AWS services and supported third-party tools, evaluates compliance against multiple standards, and helps you **identify, prioritize, and respond to security risks**.

> The Security Hub provides a single place in the AWS environment to aggregate, organize, and prioritize security alerts and discoveries from multiple AWS security services. This may be Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, IAM, Access Analyzer, AWS Firewall Manager. But it also supports third-party partner products.

## What Are Security Standards in Security Hub?

Security standards in AWS Security Hub are **automated compliance frameworks** that consist of **security controls** (automated checks) designed to enforce **best practices** in cloud security. Each **enabled standard** will:

* Continuously **evaluate your AWS account and resources**,
* Generate **control findings** if a check fails,
* Help you assess and maintain **security compliance**,
* Provide **security scores** to measure posture across accounts.

 <summary>1. AWS Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP)</summary>

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP)

### Description and Purpose:
- FSBP is a compilation of security best practices developed by AWS and industry professionals, suitable for organizations of all sectors and sizes.
- It aims to detect when your AWS accounts and deployed resources deviate from security best practices, offering prescriptive guidance to improve and maintain your security posture.
- This standard covers AWS‚Äôs most popular and foundational services, ensuring a broad scope of security checks.
- The **AWS Foundational Security Best Practices** standard is a curated set of **automated checks** that enforce **AWS-recommended configurations** for key AWS services like:
* S3, IAM, EC2, RDS, Lambda, CloudTrail, etc.

### Why It Is Used:
* To ensure your **AWS configurations follow security best practices** as defined by AWS security engineers.
* Helps teams **reduce the attack surface** in day-to-day deployments.

### Importance:
- FSBP is essential for establishing a strong security foundation in AWS. It helps prevent common misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, making it a great starting point for beginners.
- By following FSBP, you can align your environment with AWS-recommended practices, reducing the risk of security breaches.

### üß™ What It Checks:
- FSBP includes a wide range of controls, each checking a specific aspect of your AWS setup. Here are some examples:
  - _**Account.1:**_ Ensures security contact information is provided for an AWS account, so AWS can notify you in case of security issues.
  - _**ACM.1:**_ Checks if imported and ACM-issued certificates are renewed after a specified time period, ensuring secure communication.
  - **_APIGateway.1:_** Verifies that API Gateway REST and WebSocket API execution logging is enabled, important for monitoring and auditing.
  - **_AutoScaling.2:_** Ensures Auto Scaling groups are spread across multiple Availability Zones, improving reliability and security.
  - **_CloudFront.1:_** Checks if CloudFront distributions have a default root object configured, preventing misconfigurations.
  - **_RDS.1:_** Ensures Amazon RDS databases are encrypted at rest, protecting data even when not in use. RDS instances without backups.

### üìç Where It Is Used:

* All production, staging, and dev environments in AWS
* Used by **organizations of any size** looking to harden their AWS deployments

 <summary>2. CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark</summary>

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark

### üìñ What It Is:

The **Center for Internet Security (CIS)** Benchmark is an **independent** security framework specifically tailored to **AWS infrastructure**. Security Hub supports the **Level 1 controls** from this benchmark.

### üß† Why It Is Used:

* To validate your AWS configuration aligns with **independent industry-standard benchmarks**
* Frequently used by organizations preparing for **audits or external certifications**

### üß™ What It Checks:
- The CIS Benchmark includes controls that focus on key security areas. Examples include:
  - **_Avoid the use of the "root" account:_** Ensures you don‚Äôt use the root account for daily tasks, as it has full access and poses a high risk if compromised.
  - **_Ensure credentials unused for 90 days or more are disabled:_** Prevents old, unused accounts from being exploited, enhancing security.
  - **_Ensure IAM password policy requires a minimum length of 14 or greater:_** Enforces strong passwords, making them harder to guess or crack.
  - **_Ensure MFA is enabled for the "root" account:_** Adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second authentication factor.
  - **_Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22_**: Prevents public access to SSH, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to EC2 instances.
  - **_Ensure rotation for customer-created KMS keys is enabled:_** Ensures encryption keys are rotated regularly, improving security for encrypted data.

### üìç Where It Is Used:

* Organizations undergoing **internal or third-party security audits**
* Companies following **compliance-driven development** models

## üß† Bonus: How Security Hub Uses These Standards

* You can **enable one or more standards per account or per Region**.
* Security Hub **evaluates controls automatically** on a scheduled basis (usually every 12‚Äì24 hours).
* The **security score** reflects how compliant your account is with the standard.
* Failed checks become **findings**, which:

  * Contribute to your **security score**.
  * Can be remediated manually or automatically.
  * Can be exported to **SIEM, ticketing**, or **remediation pipelines**.

---

## üõ† How AWS Security Hub Works

### ‚úÖ 1. **Security Checks**

* When you **enable a security standard**, Security Hub runs **automated checks (controls)** against your AWS resources.
* Controls evaluate configurations such as S3 bucket permissions, IAM policy strengths, EC2 public access, and more.
* Each check results in a pass or fail.
* **Failed checks generate findings**, which are security issues needing attention.

### üì• 2. **Findings Collection**

* Security Hub **receives findings** from:

  * **Its own controls** (e.g., misconfigured resources)
  * **Other AWS services** like:

    * Amazon GuardDuty (threat detection)
    * Amazon Inspector (vulnerability scans)
    * Amazon Macie (sensitive data protection)
  * **Third-party tools** (firewalls, EDR, SIEM, etc.)

### üì§ 3. **Findings Forwarding**

* You can **send findings** from Security Hub to:

  * **Amazon EventBridge** for automated responses
  * **Amazon Detective** for deep investigation
  * **AWS Security Lake** or **SIEM tools** for correlation and storage
  * **AWS Chatbot** for Slack or Teams notifications

### ü§ñ 4. **Automation**

* **Automation Rules** allow you to:

  * Auto-update finding status (e.g., mark as resolved)
  * Auto-suppress known false positives
  * Trigger notifications or scripts
* **Amazon EventBridge Integration**:

  * Event-driven automation can trigger:

    * AWS Lambda functions
    * SSM OpsItems
    * Incident management workflows
