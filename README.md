# AWS Security Hub
AWS **Security Hub** is a **cloud security posture management (CSPM)** service that **centralizes and automates security checks** across your AWS environment. It aggregates findings from AWS services and supported third-party tools, evaluates compliance against multiple standards, and helps you **identify, prioritize, and respond to security risks**.

> The Security Hub provides a single place in the AWS environment to aggregate, organize, and prioritize security alerts and discoveries from multiple AWS security services. This may be Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, IAM, Access Analyzer, AWS Firewall Manager. But it also supports third-party partner products.

## üìå What Are Security Standards in Security Hub?

Security standards in AWS Security Hub are **automated compliance frameworks** that consist of **security controls** (automated checks) designed to enforce **best practices** in cloud security. Each **enabled standard** will:

* Continuously **evaluate your AWS account and resources**,
* Generate **control findings** if a check fails,
* Help you assess and maintain **security compliance**,
* Provide **security scores** to measure posture across accounts.

## üß† Bonus: How Security Hub Uses These Standards

* You can **enable one or more standards per account or per Region**.
* Security Hub **evaluates controls automatically** on a scheduled basis (usually every 12‚Äì24 hours).
* Failed checks become **findings**, which:

  * Contribute to your **security score**.
  * Can be remediated manually or automatically.
  * Can be exported to **SIEM, ticketing**, or **remediation pipelines**.


---

## üõ† How AWS Security Hub Works

### ‚úÖ 1. **Security Checks**

* When you **enable a security standard**, Security Hub runs **automated checks (controls)** against your AWS resources.
* Controls evaluate configurations such as S3 bucket permissions, IAM policy strengths, EC2 public access, and more.
* Each check results in a pass or fail.
* **Failed checks generate findings**, which are security issues needing attention.

### üì• 2. **Findings Collection**

* Security Hub **receives findings** from:

  * **Its own controls** (e.g., misconfigured resources)
  * **Other AWS services** like:

    * Amazon GuardDuty (threat detection)
    * Amazon Inspector (vulnerability scans)
    * Amazon Macie (sensitive data protection)
  * **Third-party tools** (firewalls, EDR, SIEM, etc.)

### üì§ 3. **Findings Forwarding**

* You can **send findings** from Security Hub to:

  * **Amazon EventBridge** for automated responses
  * **Amazon Detective** for deep investigation
  * **AWS Security Lake** or **SIEM tools** for correlation and storage
  * **AWS Chatbot** for Slack or Teams notifications

### ü§ñ 4. **Automation**

* **Automation Rules** allow you to:

  * Auto-update finding status (e.g., mark as resolved)
  * Auto-suppress known false positives
  * Trigger notifications or scripts
* **Amazon EventBridge Integration**:

  * Event-driven automation can trigger:

    * AWS Lambda functions
    * SSM OpsItems
    * Incident management workflows

| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP)** | AWS-created standard with best practices for securing AWS services.                          |
| **CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark**                   | Developed by the Center for Internet Security; focuses on secure AWS configuration.          |
| **PCI DSS**                                         | Ensures compliance with Payment Card Industry standards for handling credit card data.       |
| **NIST CSF**                                        | Aligns with the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. |

When a standard is **enabled**:

* Its **controls are evaluated automatically**.
* **Failed controls generate findings**, visible in the Security Hub console.
